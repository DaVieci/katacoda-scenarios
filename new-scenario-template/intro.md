# Data Handling in PySpark compared to Python

Welcome to the katakoda scenario "Data Handling in PySpark compared to Python"!

## Description

In this short scenario, you will learn how to access and transform data from different kinds of sources using Apache Spark. Moreover, you will see how that data handling would be done in Python in contrast to the approach in PySpark. 

## Learning Objective

- Read data from different kinds of files
- Perform transformations on that data
- Understand the difference between PySpark and Python when working with data

## Prerequisite Skills

This katacoda was mainly created for computer science students or ongoing data scientists with prior experience using Python.
