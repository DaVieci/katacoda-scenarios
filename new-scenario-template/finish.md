## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are advantages and disadvantages when it comes to data handling in Spark compared to Python. Doing stuff in pyspark can get a bit more complicated depending on the application or the size of the project whereas python is pretty simple and straightforward when it comes to loading data from files into a dataset or cleaning and transforming data in general. However, python (and especially pandas) is definitly not created for analysing a large amount of data that has let's say a few gigabytes in size since that data will get stored in the memory - which is limited in every computer. Apache Spark, on the other hand, was mainly created to process big data.
